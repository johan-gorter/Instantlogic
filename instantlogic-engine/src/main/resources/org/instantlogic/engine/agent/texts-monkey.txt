The Cavendish banana is the most common banana type sold.
When a banana plant is mature, the corm stops producing new leaves and begins to form a flower spike or inflorescence. 
The fruit has been described as a "leathery berry".
The word banana is generally said to be derived from the Wolof word banaana.
The genus Musa was created by Carl Linnaeus in 1753.
Musa is in the family Musaceae.
The banana may have been present in isolated locations of the Middle East on the eve of Islam.
There is some textual evidence that Muhammad was familiar with bananas.
By the 10th century the banana appears in texts from Palestine and Egypt.
From there it diffused into north Africa and Muslim Iberia.
During the medieval ages, bananas from Granada were considered among the best in the Arab world.
In 650, Islamic conquerors brought the banana to Palestine.
The Double Mahoi plant can produce two bunches at once.
The Chinese name of the aromatic Go San Heong banana means 'You can smell it from the next mountain.
Cavendish bananas are the main commercial banana cultivars sold in the world market.
Export bananas are picked green, and ripen in special rooms upon arrival in the destination country.
These rooms are air-tight and filled with ethylene gas to induce ripening.
A 2008 study reported that ripe bananas fluoresce when exposed to ultraviolet light.
Bananas must be transported over long distances from the tropics to world markets.
To obtain maximum shelf life, harvest comes before the fruit is mature.
The fruit requires careful handling, rapid transport to ports, cooling, and refrigerated shipping.
The goal is to prevent the bananas from producing their natural ripening agent, ethylene.
On arrival, bananas are held at about 17 °C (63 °F) and treated with a low concentration of ethylene.
After a few days, the fruit begins to ripen and is distributed for final sale.
Unripe bananas can not be held in home refrigerators because they suffer from the cold.
In the Japanese system, leaves and shoots are cut from the plant periodically to ensure softness.
Harvested shoots are first boiled in lye to prepare fibers for yarn-making.
This traditional Japanese cloth-making process requires many steps, all performed by hand.
The fruits grow in clusters hanging from the top of the plant.

A banana is an edible fruit produced by several kinds of large herbaceous flowering plants of the genus Musa. (In some countries, bananas used for cooking may be called plantains.) The fruit is variable in size, color and firmness, but is usually elongated and curved, with soft flesh rich in starch covered with a rind which may be yellow, purple or red when ripe. The fruits grow in clusters hanging from the top of the plant. Almost all modern edible parthenocarpic (seedless) bananas come from two wild species – Musa acuminata and Musa balbisiana. The scientific names of most cultivated bananas are Musa acuminata, Musa balbisiana, and Musa × paradisiaca for the hybrid Musa acuminata × M. balbisiana, depending on their genomic constitution. The old scientific name Musa sapientum is no longer used.
Worldwide, there is no sharp distinction between "bananas" and "plantains". Especially in the Americas and Europe, "banana" usually refers to soft, sweet, dessert bananas, particularly those of the Cavendish group, which are the main exports from banana-growing countries. By contrast, Musa cultivars with firmer, starchier fruit are called "plantains". In other regions, such as Southeast Asia, many more kinds of banana are grown and eaten, so the simple two-fold distinction is not useful and is not made in local languages.
The banana plant is the largest herbaceous flowering plant. All the above-ground parts of a banana plant grow from a structure usually called a "corm". Plants are normally tall and fairly sturdy, and are often mistaken for trees, but what appears to be a trunk is actually a "false stem" or pseudostem. Bananas grow in a wide variety of soils, as long as the soil is at least 60 cm deep, has good drainage and is not compacted. The leaves of banana plants are composed of a "stalk" (petiole) and a blade (lamina). The base of the petiole widens to form a sheath; the tightly packed sheaths make up the pseudostem, which is all that supports the plant. The edges of the sheath meet when it is first produced, making it tubular. As new growth occurs in the centre of the pseudostem the edges are forced apart.
The classification of cultivated bananas has long been a problematic issue for taxonomists. Linnaeus originally placed bananas into two species based only on their uses as food: Musa sapientum for dessert bananas and Musa paradisiaca for plantains. Subsequently further species names were added. However, this approach proved inadequate to address the sheer number of cultivars existing in the primary center of diversity of the genus, Southeast Asia. Many of these cultivars were given names which proved to be synonyms.
In a series of papers published in 1947 onwards, Ernest Cheesman showed that Linnaeus' Musa sapientum and Musa paradisiaca were actually cultivars and descendants of two wild seed-producing species, Musa acuminata and Musa balbisiana, both first described by Luigi Aloysius Colla.[29] He recommended the abolition of Linnaeus' species in favor of reclassifying bananas according to three morphologically distinct groups of cultivars – those primarily exhibiting the botanical characteristics of Musa balbisiana, those primarily exhibiting the botanical characteristics of Musa acuminata, and those with characteristics that are the combination of the two.[28] Researchers Norman Simmonds and Ken Shepherd proposed a genome-based nomenclature system in 1955. This system eliminated almost all the difficulties and inconsistencies of the earlier classification of bananas based on assigning scientific names to cultivated varieties. Despite this, the original names are still recognized by some authorities today, leading to confusion.
Bananas are naturally slightly radioactive, more so than most other fruits, because of their potassium content and the small amounts of the isotope potassium-40 found in naturally occurring potassium.
